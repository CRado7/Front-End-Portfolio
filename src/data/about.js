export const fullAbout = 'I’m a front-end web developer with a strong design background and a product-focused approach to building websites. I’ve spent the last years working across design, development, and production environments, which means I care as much about how something ships as how it looks. I enjoy turning complex requirements into clear, usable interfaces and building sites that are easy to maintain after launch. My work spans custom front-end builds, CMS-driven sites, and ongoing site management. I’ve led end-to-end website projects, collaborated with designers and stakeholders, and owned updates for live, production platforms, including work for an FDA-approved medical product where clarity and trust were essential. I’m most effective when I can bridge the gap between design and engineering, focus on real-world constraints, and build solutions that actually get used.'
